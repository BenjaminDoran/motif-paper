## Case Study with ATF7 Transcription Factor Binding Site

Utilizing the Gene Transcription Regulation Database and JASPER database [cite GTRD; JASPER] we have located 51 gens co-regulated by the transcription factor ATF7. We then retrieved locus information from the Ensemble database, before retrieving the 1000bp upstream sequences from the GCR38 human genome assembly in NCBI.
