# Abstract

This paper applies the UniDip algorithm to the problem of genomic motif discovery. UniDip is a noise robust clustering algorithm based on the Hartigan's statistical test for unimodality, commonly called the dip-test. UniDip is different from other algorithms because it starts from the assumption that most data are noise only isolating regions of high density. Our work involves transforming symbolic genomic sequences into a data format compatible with UniDip's input requirements, including handling mis-alignments, mutations, and spurious motifs. We find that UniDip is capable of motif discovery on real genomic sequences, successfully isolating the ATF7 transcription factor binding site from the human genome assembly.
