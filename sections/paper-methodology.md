# Methodology

We begin applying unimodality clustering to motif discovery with a discussion on implementing the UniDip algorithm, because algorithms in practice are never as simple as they are in theory.

Sorted

modified mirroring

losing detail

## Applying to Symbolic Data

> ...Need to Write...

simplest case insert mono-symbolic exact motif into uniformly distributed background noise

counts to scaled negative entropy.

## Applying to Multi-Letter Motifs

> ...Need to Write...

scaled negative entropy works in this case as well

## Applying to Degenerate Data

> TODO

adding in randomness to the motif (degeneracy)

## Single Motifs

use mirroring

## Applying to Differently Aligned Motifs

> TODO

This is the biggest limitation

It can be moderately alleviated by using a global alignment. But more extensive workarounds are beyond the scale of this project.

## Filtering Out Spurious Motifs
