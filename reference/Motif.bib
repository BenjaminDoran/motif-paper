The list of databases which are linked to the common GENE table of TRANSFAC and TRANSCompel has been extended by: Ensembl, UniGene, EntrezGene, HumanPSD and TRANSPRO. Standard gene names from HGNC, MGI and RGD, are included for human, mouse and rat genes, respectively. With the help of InterProScan, Pfam, SMART and PROSITE domains are assigned automatically to the protein sequences of the transcription factors. TRANSCompel contains now, in addition to the COMPEL table, a separate table for detailed information on the experimental EVIDENCE on which the composite elements are based. Finally, for TRANSFAC, in respect of data growth, in particular the gain of Drosophila transcription factor binding sites (by courtesy of the Drosophila DNase I footprint database) and of Arabidopsis factors (by courtesy of DATF, Database of Arabidopsis Transcription Factors) has to be stressed.

	abstract = {Pattern discovery in unaligned DNA sequences is a challenging problem in both computer science and molecular biology. Several different methods and techniques have been proposed so far, but in most of the cases signals in DNA sequences are very complicated and avoid detection. Exact exhaustive methods can solve the problem only for short signals with a limited number of mutations. In this work, we extend exhaustive enumeration also to longer patterns. More in detail, the basic version of algorithm presented in this paper, given as input a set of sequences and an error ratio epsilon {\textless} 1, finds all patterns that occur in at least q sequences of the set with at most epsilonm mutations, where m is the length of the pattern. The only restriction is imposed on the location of mutations along the signal. That is, a valid occurrence of a pattern can present at most [epsiloni] mismatches in the first i nucleotides, and so on. However, we show how the algorithm can be used also when no assumption can be made on the position of mutations. In this case, it is also possible to have an estimate of the probability of finding a signal according to the signal length, the error ratio, and the input parameters. Finally, we discuss some significance measures that can be used to sort the patterns output by the algorithm.},

Because the DNA motif recognized by a transcription factor is typically short and degenerate, computational approaches for identifying binding sites based only on the sequence motif inevitably suffer from high error rates. Current state-of-the-art techniques for improving computational identification of binding sites can be broadly categorized into two classes: (1) approaches that aim to improve binding motif models by extracting maximal sequence information from experimentally determined binding sites and (2) approaches that supplement binding motif models with additional genomic or other attributes (such as evolutionary conservation). In this review we will discuss recent attempts to improve computational identification of TFBS through these two types of approaches and conclude with thoughts on future development.Contact:sridharh@pcbi.upenn.edu},

In this study we identify sequence dependent characteristics that are conserved in the DNA-binding zinc fingers and are probably required for a functional DNA-binding zinc finger. Examination of the conserved properties in view of the solved three dimensional structure of a zinc finger, confirms the importance of most of these properties. The absence of the identified physical-chemical characteristics from CCHH containing sequences of non-DNA binding proteins suggest that they can be used to distinguish between spurious and actual DNA binding zinc fingers.},

Here, we present a comparative analysis of the human, mouse, rat and dog genomes to create a systematic catalogue of common regulatory motifs in promoters and 3′ untranslated regions (3 ′ UTRs). The promoter analysis yields 174 candidate motifs, including most previously known transcription-factor binding sites and 105 new motifs. The 3′-UTR analysis yields 106 motifs likely to be involved in post-transcriptional regulation. Nearly one-half are associated with microRNAs (miRNAs), leading to the discovery of many new miRNA genes and their likely target genes. Our results suggest that previous estimates of the number of human miRNA genes were low, and that miRNAs regulate at least 20\% of human genes. The overall results provide a systematic view of gene regulation in the human, which will be refined as additional mammalian genomes become available.},

	abstract = {MOTIVATION: Molecular biologists frequently can obtain interesting insight by aligning a set of related DNA, RNA or protein sequences. Such alignments can be used to determine either evolutionary or functional relationships. Our interest is in identifying functional relationships. Unless the sequences are very similar, it is necessary to have a specific strategy for measuring-or scoring-the relatedness of the aligned sequences. If the alignment is not known, one can be determined by finding an alignment that optimizes the scoring scheme.
RESULTS: We describe four components to our approach for determining alignments of multiple sequences. First, we review a log-likelihood scoring scheme we call information content. Second, we describe two methods for estimating the P value of an individual information content score: (i) a method that combines a technique from large-deviation statistics with numerical calculations; (ii) a method that is exclusively numerical. Third, we describe how we count the number of possible alignments given the overall amount of sequence data. This count is multiplied by the P value to determine the expected frequency of an information content score and, thus, the statistical significance of the corresponding alignment. Statistical significance can be used to compare alignments having differing widths and containing differing numbers of sequences. Fourth, we describe a greedy algorithm for determining alignments of functionally related sequences. Finally, we test the accuracy of our P value calculations, and give an example of using our algorithm to identify binding sites for the Escherichia coli CRP protein.

	abstract = {As an increasing number of eukaryotic genomes are being sequenced, comparative studies aimed at detecting regulatory elements in intergenic sequences are becoming more prevalent. Most comparative methods for transcription factor (TF) binding site discovery make use of global or local alignments of orthologous regulatory regions to assess whether a particular DNA site is conserved across related organisms, and thus more likely to be functional. Since binding sites are usually short, sometimes degenerate, and often independent of orientation, alignment algorithms may not align them correctly. Here, we present a novel, alignment-free approach for using conservation information for TF binding site discovery. We relax the definition of conserved sites: we consider a DNA site within a regulatory region to be conserved in an orthologous sequence if it occurs anywhere in that sequence, irrespective of orientation. We use this definition to derive informative priors over DNA sequence positions, and incorporate these priors into a Gibbs sampling algorithm for motif discovery. Our approach is simple and fast. It requires neither sequence alignments nor the phylogenetic relationships between the orthologous sequences, yet it is more effective on real biological data than methods that do.},

	abstract = {One of the major challenges in bioinformatics is the development of efficient computational algorithms for biological sequence motif discovery. In the post-genomic era, the ability to predict the behavior, the function, or the structure of biological entities or motifs such as genes and proteins, as well as interactions among them, play a fundamental role in the discovery of information to help explain biological mechanisms. This necessitated the development of computational methods for identifying these entities. Consequently, a large number of motif finding algorithms have been implemented and applied to various organisms over the past decade. This paper presents a comparative analysis of the latest developments in motif finding algorithms and proposed an algorithm for motif discovery based on a combinatorial approach of pattern driven and statistical based approach. The proposed algorithm, Suffix Tree Gene Enrichment Motif Searching (STGEMS) as reported in [30], proved effective in identifying motifs from organisms with peculiarity in their genomic structure such as the AT-rich sequence of the malaria parasite, \textit{P. falciparum}. The empirical time analysis of seven motif discovery algorithms was evaluated using four sets of genes from the intraerythrocytic development cycle of \textit{P. falciparum}. The result shows that algorithms based on a combinatorial approach are more desirable.},

	abstract = {We have developed a method for identifying consensus patterns in a set of unaligned DNA sequences known to bind a common protein or to have some other common biochemical function. The method is based on a matrix representation of binding site patterns. Each row of the matrix represents one of the four possible bases, each column represents one of the positions of the binding site and each element is determined by the frequency the indicated base occurs at the indicated position. The goal of the method is to find the most significant matrix--i.e. the one with the lowest probability of occurring by chance--out of all the matrices that can be formed from the set of related sequences. The reliability of the method improves with the number of sequences, while the time required increases only linearly with the number of sequences. To test this method, we analysed 11 DNA sequences containing promoters regulated by the Escherichia coli LexA protein. The matrices we found were consistent with the known consensus sequence, and could distinguish the generally accepted LexA binding sites from other DNA sequences.},

We have carried out an analysis on 500 bacterial genomes and found that the de-facto GC skew method could predict the replication origin site only for 376 genomes. We also found that the auto-correlation and cross-correlation based methods have a similar prediction performance. In this paper, we propose a new measure called correlated entropy measure (CEM) which is able to predict the replication origin of all these 500 bacterial genomes. The proposed measure is context sensitive and thus a promising tool to identify functional sites. The process of identifying replication origins from the output of CEM and other methods has been automated to analyze a large number of genomes in a faster manner. We have also explored the applicability of SVM based classification of the workability of each of these methods on all the 500 bacterial genomes based on its length and GC content.},

	abstract = {In this article, we propose a methodology for identifying predictive physiological patterns in the absence of prior knowledge. We use the principle of conservation to identify activity that consistently precedes an outcome in patients, and describe a two-stage process that allows us to efficiently search for such patterns in large datasets. This involves first transforming continuous physiological signals from patients into symbolic sequences, and then searching for patterns in these reduced representations that are strongly associated with an outcome., Our strategy of identifying conserved activity that is unlikely to have occurred purely by chance in symbolic data is analogous to the discovery of regulatory motifs in genomic datasets. We build upon existing work in this area, generalizing the notion of a regulatory motif and enhancing current techniques to operate robustly on non-genomic data. We also address two significant considerations associated with motif discovery in general: computational efficiency and robustness in the presence of degeneracy and noise. To deal with these issues, we introduce the concept of active regions and new subset-based techniques such as a two-layer Gibbs sampling algorithm. These extensions allow for a framework for information inference, where precursors are identified as approximately conserved activity of arbitrary complexity preceding multiple occurrences of an event., We evaluated our solution on a population of patients who experienced sudden cardiac death and attempted to discover electrocardiographic activity that may be associated with the endpoint of death. To assess the predictive patterns discovered, we compared likelihood scores for motifs in the sudden death population against control populations of normal individuals and those with non-fatal supraventricular arrhythmias. Our results suggest that predictive motif discovery may be able to identify clinically relevant information even in the absence of significant prior knowledge.},

Although such settings occur in the real-world, we struggle to find methods from the abundance of clustering techniques that perform well with noise at this level. Indeed, perhaps this is enough of a departure from classical clustering to warrant its study as a separate problem. In this paper we present SkinnyDip which, based on Hartigan's elegant dip test of unimodality, represents an intriguing approach to clustering with an attractive set of properties. Specifically, SkinnyDip is highly noise-robust, practically parameter-free and completely deterministic. SkinnyDip never performs multivariate distance calculations, but rather employs insightful recursion based on "dips" into univariate projections of the data. It is able to detect a range of cluster shapes and densities, assuming only that each cluster admits a unimodal shape. Practically, its run-time grows linearly with the data. Finally, for high-dimensional data, continuity properties of the dip enable SkinnyDip to exploit multimodal projection pursuit in order to find an appropriate basis for clustering. Although not without its limitations, SkinnyDip compares favorably to a variety of clustering approaches on synthetic and real data, particularly in high-noise settings.},

It covers a wide range of phenotypic abnormalities encountered in human diseases and its terms (classes) are structured according to a directed acyclic graph. In this context the prediction of the phenotypic abnormalities associated to human genes is a key tool to stratify patients into disease subclasses that share a common biological or pathophisiological basis. Methods are being developed to predict the HPO terms that are associated for a given disease or disease gene, but most such methods adopt a simple ”flat” approach, that is they do not take into account the hierarchical relationships of the HPO, thus loosing important a priori information about HPO terms. In this contribution we propose a novel Hierarchical Top-Down (HTD) algorithm that associates a specific learner to each HPO term and then corrects the predictions according to the hierarchical structure of the underlying DAG. Genome-wide experimental results relative to a complex HPO DAG including more than 4000 HPO terms show that the proposed hierarchical-aware approach significantly improves predictions obtained with flat methods, especially in terms of precision/recall results.},

	abstract = {With the evolution of time the gene composition of species have changed a lot. Consequently it has mutated to generate new diseases and traits. In order to identify genes or coding sections of a DNA sequence it is imperative to find out the promoter regions or the conserved regions of the DNA code first. But the main problem stands that the databases for these information are quite messy and needs to be researched. The main problems in finding motifs in a DNA sequence are finding a good and fast algorithm, considering mutations in those motifs, representing variable length motifs and being species generic. In this paper we tried to formulate a new algorithm which is fast, accurate and effective. Instead of general string matching of DNA sequences we have done integer mapping and matching which are comparatively fast and accurate. Besides in order to formulate a complete DNA motif finding algorithm we also need a generalized and rational fitness function for evaluating the potential motifs. Thus we have formulated a desirable fitness function that enables us to compare the relativity among potential motifs and finally to predict a certain motif for the input DNA sequences.},

	abstract = {A major challenge in molecular biology is reverse-engineering the cis-regulatory logic that plays a major role in the control of gene expression. This program includes searching through DNA sequences to identify “motifs” that serve as the binding sites for transcription factors or, more generally, are predictive of gene expression across cellular conditions. Several approaches have been proposed for de novo motif discovery–searching sequences without prior knowledge of binding sites or nucleotide patterns. However, unbiased validation is not straightforward. We consider two approaches to unbiased validation of discovered motifs: testing the statistical significance of a motif using a DNA “background” sequence model to represent the null hypothesis and measuring performance in predicting membership in gene clusters. We demonstrate that the background models typically used are “too null,” resulting in overly optimistic assessments of significance, and argue that performance in predicting TF binding or expression patterns from DNA motifs should be assessed by held-out data, as in predictive learning. Applying this criterion to common motif discovery methods resulted in universally poor performance, although there is a marked improvement when motifs are statistically significant against real background sequences. Moreover, on synthetic data where “ground truth” is known, discriminative performance of all algorithms is far below the theoretical upper bound, with pronounced “over-fitting” in training. A key conclusion from this work is that the failure of de novo discovery approaches to accurately identify motifs is basically due to statistical intractability resulting from the fixed size of co-regulated gene clusters, and thus such failures do not necessarily provide evidence that unfound motifs are not active biologically. Consequently, the use of prior knowledge to enhance motif discovery is not just advantageous but necessary. An implementation of the LR and ALR algorithms is available at http://code.google.com/p/likelihood-ratio-motifs/.},

The popular MEME motif discovery algorithm is now complemented by the GLAM2 algorithm which allows discovery of motifs containing gaps. Three sequence scanning algorithms—MAST, FIMO and GLAM2SCAN—allow scanning numerous DNA and protein sequence databases for motifs discovered by MEME and GLAM2. Transcription factor motifs (including those discovered using MEME) can be compared with motifs in many popular motif databases using the motif database scanning algorithm Tomtom. Transcription factor motifs can be further analyzed for putative function by association with Gene Ontology (GO) terms using the motif-GO term association tool GOMO. MEME output now contains sequence LOGOS for each discovered motif, as well as buttons to allow motifs to be conveniently submitted to the sequence and motif database scanning algorithms (MAST, FIMO and Tomtom), or to GOMO, for further analysis. GLAM2 output similarly contains buttons for further analysis using GLAM2SCAN and for rerunning GLAM2 with different parameters. All of the motif-based tools are now implemented as web services via Opal. Source code, binaries and a web server are freely available for noncommercial use at http://meme.nbcr.net.},
